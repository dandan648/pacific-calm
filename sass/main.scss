/*
note on font size, always use rem instead of pixels. for the base font size dont 
use pixels either, use a percentage of 100% - this acounts for the users own browser font setting
and whenever they change it, it will adjust to their prefered font size  HOWEVER - when you want your 
font size, eg 10 px - you must divide 10 by 16(standard root font size) = 62.5% - this will also
adjust to the users prefered font size 

if you have to develope a site for very old interent explorer versions then you need to use 
pixels and not rem
